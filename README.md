Welcome to my Fin App
=====================

This is a web application for managing categories and transactions.

Features:

*   View and manage [Categories]
*   View and manage [Operations]
*   Generate [Reports] based on categories and dates

Technologies Used:

*   Ruby on Rails 7
*   Bootstrap 5
*   SQLite for development and Postgresql for production

Improvements that I would like to make:

*   Add authentication and authorization (devise gem)
*   Add an admin user who can manage users
*   Add search and filtering functionality
*   Implement more data validation and error handling
*   Add to-do list
